# NoiseRemoving

Kia Ora
This is a program where you add images that have what's know as noise in them. When you run the program is tries to find the median of the colours around it and changes it so that it will hopefully remove all the noise. I have added 3 jpg files that you can use to play around with to see if it works. It will then be saved to the file under noise removed (as you can see one has already been added from the testing). Trying to find the median of the colours around it is found using a quick sort which has it's own file if you are looking to learn about it. If you find that this stops working feel free to reach out so I can fix any bugs. Enjoy/
